Hello and welcome to my humble resume in order to make sure the project will run without any bugs please open the executable named chessGraphics and only then
run the server side which is the project itself 

Implemented core game logic 
(legal move validation, check/checkmate detection, game state handling) in C++ for a chess application.
\\The visual board UI was provided externally.//
